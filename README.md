BITS-VISION
Welcome to the BITS-VISION GitHub repository!

Project Overview
Device Name: BITS-VISION
Project Ambition: To build technology for people; think about people while building your technology. Not technology for technology's sake.

Abstract
Hello, fellow GitHubbers!

I am an amateur developer and the brain behind BITS-VISION, an Electronic Travel Aid (ETA) designed to assist visually impaired individuals around the globe. This project is my pro bono effort to make a meaningful impact on the lives of those who need it most.

If you are passionate about technology—whether you're in Computer Science, IT, Electrical & Electronics Engineering, or any other discipline—or if you are interested in venture funding, charity work, or volunteering, I invite you to join this initiative. Let's contribute to humanity together. You can contact me through this platform for collaboration.

Note: This is a genuine effort to help people, not a business venture.

Project Details
Motivation
In many developing and underdeveloped countries, ETAs are often prohibitively expensive. For example:

MINI GUIDE by GDP Australia costs around $500. (https://www.gdp-research.com.au/minig_1.htm)
Smart Cane by IIT Delhi costs approximately INR 3500.
Given these high costs, my goal is to provide a more affordable and accessible solution for visually impaired individuals. BITS-VISION utilizes HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. While these sensors are not perfect—they are unidirectional and cannot detect objects behind them—they offer a starting point. As the saying goes, "something is better than nothing."

Current Limitations
Reliability: The HC-SR04 sensors are not highly reliable for critical applications where a person's safety is at stake.
Directionality: These sensors can only detect objects in front of them and cannot sense obstacles behind.
Despite these limitations, I believe that BITS-VISION can provide significant assistance to visually impaired individuals in areas where more advanced devices are unaffordable.

Future Improvements
I am actively working on enhancing the device's capabilities, with a focus on:

Improved Safety: Developing better automation and identification systems to enhance reliability and user safety.
Smart Features: Incorporating smart technologies to make the device more intuitive and user-friendly.
How to Contribute
Your involvement can make a big difference! Here are some ways you can contribute:
